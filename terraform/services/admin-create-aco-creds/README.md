# Terraform for Admin Create ACO Credentials function and associated infra

This service sets up the infrastructure for the Admin Create ACO Credentials lambda function in upper and lower environments for BCDA.

## Manual deploy

Pass in a backend file when running terraform init. See variables.tf for variables to include. Example:

```bash

```

## Automated deploy

This terraform is automatically applied on merge to main by the admin-create-aco-creds-apply.yml workflow.
