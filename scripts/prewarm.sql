-- Run this script following a postgres DB restore in RDS to get data out of
-- lazy loading. On a ~250GB database, this takes around 15 minutes. A VACUUM
-- FULL on the same database takes hours. This script does the following:
--
-- - Runs VACUUM ANALYZE to update postgres stats on relpages, etc.
-- - Prints out the table of relations to be warmed
-- - Enables the pg_prewarm extension if it hasn't been enabled already
-- - Prints out the relation name and number of blocks warmed as it loops
--
-- This script must be run on each database in the cluster. To run with
-- timing in psql:
--
--   postgres=> \timing
--   postgres=> \c prod
--   prod=> \i prewarm.sql

-- Run VACUUM ANALYZE to update postgres stats on relpages, etc.
